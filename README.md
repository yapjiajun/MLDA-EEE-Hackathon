# MLDA-EEE-Hackathon

## Casco.AI
Casco.AI is an AI application that uses deep learning and object recogision that aims to reduce workplace hazard by identifying workers who are not in proper Personal Protective Equipments (PPEs).

## Motivation
The reason why we wanted to work on this project is because of the increasing cases of workplace related death in Singapore. We hope that we can tap on the advantages of AI to mitigate workplace related incidents that can be prevented with proper wearing of PPEs


## Tech/Framework used
Pytorch and Yolov5 -- Training of Models
Roboflow -- Getting Data Sets
